## Introduction
### The environmental challenge
The current environmental situation is a major concern for the world nowadays as it

keeps getting worse and worse. People are urged to find a way out and suggest solu-
tions for this dilemma.

Sustainability is the key to prevent or reduce the effect of environmental issues. There

is now clear scientific evidence that humanity is living unsustainably, and that an un-
precedented collective effort is needed to return human use of natural resources to

within sustainable limits.
### MENA Hackathon
As it is their duty more than any other category, Youth are urged now more than ever
to think out of the box to sort out an innovative proposal for the problematics
The Kingdom Of Bahrain offered to young individuals minds with various skills the

opportunity to unleash their creative ideas and come up with brilliant tech-based solu-
tions in the form of applications and prototypes to overcome any identified challenges

existing in different world sectors.
We are privileged to be part of this year’s edition. It’s a great honor for us to be
able to participate at this level and get in touch with Bahrain’s most notable scientific
figures. This will undoubtedly be a fruitful experience for us and hopefully we will be
able to turn our idea into something that would change the world.
*** ”Be the change you want to see in this world”*** -Mahatma Ghandi-
### What problematic are we trying to answer?
As introduced earlier, we had a hard time setting only one challenge to solve, as they
were all important to us, so we decided to get around this limitation, we looked for a
way to solve several problems in parallel, to make a whole community work to find a

solution to each problem raised in the framework of the chosen theme: Energy, Envi-
ronment, and sustainability.

In short, the goal we set for ourselves was to find a way to develop solutions to an
unlimited number of problems.
### What solutions do we offer?
The solution we propose is AGAMA, a social network totally focused on ecology, in
order to take advantage of the strength of a whole committed community. This social
network will have different main objectives which will be detailed later, but among
them, we can mention:

• For developers of eco-responsible projects: we offer them a way to receive advice
from experts in different fields for free, to finance their projects through crowdfunding
but also to attract volunteers to help them if needed.
• For the owners of finished projects: we allow them to promote their projects/services.
• For the citizens who want to have a green lifestyle: they will have a large panel
of products and companies that will help them to take the step.
All this while maintaining communication and exchange between the different actors

** This social network will be materialized by an application and a website**
